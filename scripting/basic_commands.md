# Basic commands

Basic commands are used to automate basic interactions with web applications, such as navigating to a URL, filling in forms, clicking on buttons, and checking if a particular text is visible.

These are the most essential commands you need for testing most of your web application:

* `I.goTo` - Navigate to a URL
* `I.click` - Click on something
* `I.fill` - Fill a text input
* `I.see` - Assert that something is seen, typically, a message.
