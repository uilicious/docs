# Basic commands

Basic commands are used to automate basic interactions with web applications, such as navigating to a URL, filling in forms, clicking on buttons, and checking if a particular text is visible.

These are the most essential commands you need for testing most of your web application:

* [`I.goTo`](/scripting/navigation.md#igoto) - Navigate to a URL
* [`I.click`](/scripting/mouse.md#iclick) - Click on something
* [`I.fill`](/scripting/form_input.md#ifill) - Fill a text input
* [`I.see`](/scripting/assertion.md#isee) - Assert that something is seen, typically, a message.
