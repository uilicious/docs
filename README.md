# Welcome!

UI-licious is a simple and robust tool for automating modern web applications.

Use it to test your web applications to make sure that your users aren't running into unexpected errors in critical user flows like when they are registering for an account or checking out their order.


## Do I need to know how to code?

No, not at all! 

You don't need to know any of the wizardry that goes on underneath your web pages.

Just write your tests as if you are telling your dad to log into Facebook over the phone.
  
```javascript
I.goTo("https://facebook.com");
I.fill("Email", "peter@example.com");
I.fill("Password", "mysupersecretpassword");
I.click("Login");
I.see("Peter");
```

## Can I use it for &lt;insert front-end framework&gt;?

Yes. 

ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS, Polymer, VanillaJS, you name it! 

It doesn't matter.
