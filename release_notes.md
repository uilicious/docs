#### Breaking Changes
* When `I.click` opens a page in a new tab, the browser will be automatically switched to it.
    * If you are using `I.switchTab` to switch tabs after `I.click`, you can remove `I.switchTab`, or *(not recommended)* add `TEST.autoSwitchTab = false` or `TEST.autoSwitchTabOff()` to the start of your test scripts to disable this behavior.

#### Highlights
* You can set the max duration to attempt a command before raising an error with the `TEST.commandTimeout` setting.  

##### New

New Commands:
* Refresh a page: `I.refreshPage`
* Scrolling a page: `I.scrollBy`, `I.scrollTo`, `I.scrollToTop`, `I.scrollToBottom`
* &uarr; &uarr; &darr; &darr; &larr; &rarr; &larr; &rarr; `B` `A` <br>Shortcuts to press arrow keys: `I.pressUp`, `I.pressDown`, `I.pressLeft`, `I.pressRight`

New Configurations:
* You can set the max duration to attempt a command before raising an error with the `TEST.commandTimeout` setting. 
* You can enable / disable automatic screenshots taken during test runs with the `TEST.autoScreenshot` flag.
* You can enable / disable automatic tab switching when new tab is open with the `TEST.autoSwitchTab` flag.
    
##### Enhancements
* Condensed the project directory, so you can see more.
* Asset optimizations to improve load time
* Separate runner pane from script pane so that the runner pane doesn't reload as you switch between different scripts which can be annoying during test runs.

* Fixed: Error moving files to project root.

### 1.3.0

*Released on 21 June 2017*

* Added support for testing [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/)! [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) is now a supported framework. Woohoo! 
* Added [`I.grabText`](/scripting/extract.md#igrabtext) command to read a text from an element in a web page to use as an input variable for subsequent test commands:
```javascript
// example usage:
I.see("Thank you for ordering from UI-licious pizza. Your order number is"); // you have finished ordering pizza
var orderId = I.grabText("#orderId"); // read the text from the #orderId element on the webpage
I.goTo("/orders"); // go to your order history page 
I.click(orderId);
```
* Added CSS class selector and XPATH support for [`I.click`](/scripting/mouse.md#iclick) command
    * It is recommended that you use these sparingly, because it would make your tests harder to maintain.    


* Fixed: `I.press` support on Firefox
* Fixed: Studio briefly flashes when a project or a test loads.

### 1.2.0

*Released on 03 May 2017*

* Added a chat box so that you can talk to our technical team!
* Added shorter commands to save keystrokes:
    * [`I.fill`](/scripting/form_input.md#ifill) - Shortcut for `I.fillField`
    * [`I.press`](/scripting/keyboard.md#ipress) - Shortcut for `I.pressKey`
    * [`I.pressEnter`](/scripting/keyboard.md#ipressenter) - Shortcut for `I.pressKey('Enter')`
* Added [`I.switchTab`](/scripting/navigation.md#iswitchtab) to switch to webpages that open in a new window or tab
* Added [`I.filled`](/scripting/assertion.md#ifilled) command to assert the value of a textual input field
* Powered up the [`I.goTo`](/scripting/navigation.md#igoto) command. Now you can navigate to pages with paths relative to the current url. For example:

```javascript
I.goTo("https://petstore.com/store");
I.goTo("/toys"); // this will navigate to https://petstore.com/store/toys
```
* Powered up the [`I.fill`](/scripting/form_input.md#ifill) command. It's now better at identifying input fields. Now it handles non-semantic field labels.
* Capture screenshots every second during [`I.wait`](/scripting/utility.md#iwait) command. Now you can watch lolcats videos at 1FPS in UI-licious
* Shortened the timeout when a command fails from 30 seconds to 15 seconds.
* You can move files and folders.
* Sort file and folders by name.
* Folders can be collapsed/expanded to hide/show their contents. They will be collapsed by default.
* More condensed report - so that you will have to scroll less while reading very long test run reports.
* You are no longer allowed to enter the following characters in your project/folder/file names: / ? % * : | < > "

* Fixed: Test report summary gets scrolled out of view when report is very long. We've fixed the position of the test report summary so that it doesn't happen.
